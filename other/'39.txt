       D                     Em                            
In the year of '39 assembled here the Volunteers
       C         G          D                              
In the days when lands were few
         Em          G            C                        
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
    D+g      D          G                                          
The sweetest sight ever seen.

        D                                                
And the night followed day
        B7                                                
And the story tellers say
         Em                  C                             
That the score brave souls inside
    G                        D                            
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
G            Em    C     D       C     G                       
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried.

G  D   D   D   D   D
Ba-dah dah dah dah dah...

          G                          C          G          
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
          G       C  G    D                               
Don't you hear me calling you
           G       B7     Em                                
Write your letters in the sand
        C     G         Am                                 
For the day I take your hand
       Em            D             G                        
In the land that our grandchildren knew.

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh

For the earth is old and grey, little darling we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me.

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew.

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand

For my life
Still ahead
Pity Me.
