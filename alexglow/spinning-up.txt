you sent us spinning up
            Am
hitchhiking to the sky
  Em                 F
a cloud of eyes that gaze at our makers

   C                      F
on wings that breathe the light of day
     G                  G7
four hundred kilometers up -- our computers

         C
spinning up
           Am
weathering solar storms
   Em                 F
to trace the pulse of forests and nations

           C                    E
'cause the world's too big when you're on the ground
G                             G7
we'll be your conscience that runs on electrons
         C
spinning up

[Instr.]
C Am Em
C Am G G7

we watch you spinning up
eating into the dark
sentient dust that dreams of connection

from way up here we see you as one
and every day
we watch our world waking, looking up
at us
looking down

spinning up
for a while
falling down

...burning up...
...you're waking up

background from yuri gagarin:
oblyetev' zemlyu, uvidel kak prekrasna nasha planeta
budem xranit' y priumnozhat' yeyo
"orbiting the earth [in my Sputnik ship], I saw how beautiful our planet is.
[Everyone,] Let us preserve and increase [that beauty]"
