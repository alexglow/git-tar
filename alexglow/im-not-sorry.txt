  Em                   C
I met you in autumn of 5015
G                         D
Fighting the great Boiler War
Em                   C
I was a soldier, and you were still green
    Am                      D
But both of us knew we were looking for more
        Em                   C
So when I felt the zeppelins calling to me
    G                           D
You said you would sail with me too
    Em                      C
And we commandeered Airship Z-33 
        Am                    C
and set sail on the waterless sea

        G     D           Em      C
And the earth sank down below us (mmm)
    G                       D            C
And we were a silver-finned whale on the evening glow
    G        D             Em         C
The ray guns fizzed in the distance,
    G                   D                  C
But we made it over the mountains, soaring low


And then you decided to give me it straight:
You'd been on the run from the law
For shooting your buddy, a man of the State
But now was a chance - you could salvage your fate
Since stealing the ship put a price on my head,
You'd take me to town with a choke 'round my neck.
"I'll miss you, but I am not sorry," you said...
then I punched your lights out and turned you in instead,

And the sky blackened before you
And you took your last flight while shackles held you down
Beneath the drone of propellers,
I whispered, "I'm not sorry either, Billy Brown..."

And I stood by the launch pad
And studied the stars as your ship geared up to go.
The plumes of steam rose between us,
And while you drifted over me, I watched the trails grow.

    G   D           Em      C G D              C
And no, no, I'm not sorry...      not sorry at all...
